# Ghidra Reverse Engineering Project

This project is part of my journey to learn C++ and reverse engineering using the Ghidra tool.

## Project Overview
- **Program Name**: Password Checker
- **Purpose**: A simple C++ program that asks for a password and validates it. It will later be reverse-engineered using Ghidra.

## Files
- `password_checker.cpp`: The source code.
- `password_checker.exe`: The compiled executable.

## Next Steps
- Load the executable into Ghidra.
- Document the reverse engineering process.
